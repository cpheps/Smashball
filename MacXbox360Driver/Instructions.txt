If you have been having issues with the driver, here is how to get the driver working on Yosemite:
Install the driver from the link above as normal
Open Terminal and type the following command:

sudo nvram boot-args="kext-dev-mode=1"

Reboot your computer. When it's back up, open terminal again and type the following command all at once:

sudo kextcache -m /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup/Extensions.mkext /System/Library/Extensions

Reboot again and your Xbox controller should be working!
